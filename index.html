            <div class="subtitle">A Progressive Development Model for Business Analytics Excellence</div>
        </div>

        <div class="intro-text">
            <p><strong>About This Framework:</strong> This competency framework defines the essential capabilities that MSBA students develop throughout their program. Each competency progresses through three developmental levelsâ€”Fundamental, Intermediate, and Advancedâ€”reflecting increasing sophistication, independence, and strategic application.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Philosophy:</strong> Built on evidence-based pedagogical principles, this framework emphasizes growth mindset, authentic assessment, and real-world application. Students are expected to demonstrate cumulative mastery, with each level building upon and integrating prior learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="understanding-framework">
            <h2>ðŸ“š Understanding This Framework</h2>
            
            <h3>A Developmental Continuum, Not Fixed Categories</h3>
            <p>These competency levels represent a <strong>developmental continuum</strong> rather than mutually exclusive categories. This design reflects how learning actually works:</p>
            
            <div class="framework-principle">
                <h4>âœ“ Students demonstrate capabilities across multiple levels simultaneously</h4>
                <p>It's normal to show consistent Fundamental skills while exhibiting emerging Intermediate capabilities in some areas. Competency development is uneven and context-dependentâ€”you might be Advanced in storytelling but still developing AI integration skills.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-principle">
                <h4>âœ“ Performance varies by context, task complexity, and domain familiarity</h4>
                <p>The same student might demonstrate Intermediate competency on familiar tasks but regress to Fundamental approaches when facing novel, complex, or high-pressure situations. This is expected and normal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-principle">
                <h4>âœ“ Assessment identifies patterns and trajectories, not classifications</h4>
                <p>Rather than labeling students as "a Fundamental student," assessment should describe patterns: "Consistently demonstrates Fundamental capabilities with emerging Intermediate skills in X and Y." Focus on growth trajectory, not fixed placement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-principle">
                <h4>âœ“ Growth is evidenced by increasing consistency at higher levels over time</h4>
                <p>Development means showing Intermediate capabilities more frequently, in more contexts, and with greater independence. Advanced level represents sustained mastery that you can demonstrate across diverse, complex situations.</p>

                <p>A student analyzes customer churn data for a retail company. They create a presentation that opens with the business context (quarterly churn has increased to 22%, costing $2M in lost revenue), uses a dashboard visualization showing churn rates by customer segment and purchase frequency, and presents three specific retention strategies with projected ROI. When the VP of Marketing asks about seasonal patterns, the student adjusts their explanation from technical language about time-series decomposition to a business-friendly discussion of "holiday shopping behavior trends." The recommendations include specific implementation steps and success metrics.</p>

Rather than accepting the AI's initial summary, they design a multi-step prompt sequence: first extracting themes, then validating those themes against HR literature, then quantifying sentiment by department. They notice the AI misclassifies sarcastic comments as positive, so they refine their prompt to flag ambiguous responses for manual review. They compare AI-identified themes with their own close reading of 50 responses, finding 85% agreement. In their final report, they transparently document their AI workflow, explain why they used AI for initial theme extraction but validated manually, and note the limitations of sentiment analysis on culturally diverse workforce comments.</p>

Rather than concluding the redesign caused the increase, they investigate further: checking whether a concurrent marketing campaign might confound results, examining whether the increase was consistent across product categories (it wasn'tâ€”only electronics increased), and reviewing whether seasonal patterns could explain the change (the increase started before typical holiday shopping). They discover the data excludes returned items, which spiked 40% for electronics during this period.

When a team member misses a deadline due to a family emergency, they proactively redistribute tasks and update the project timeline, then check in privately to offer support.</p>
                <p class="example-demonstrates"><strong>This demonstrates:</strong> Proactive knowledge sharing, facilitation of inclusive discussions, integration of deliverables, flexible role adaptation, and supportive team culture (Intermediate behaviors #1, #2, #3, #4, #6).</p>

            <h2>IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE</h2>
            
            <div class="key-principles">
                <h4>ðŸŽ¯ Core Pedagogical Principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Progressive Mastery:</strong> Competencies build cumulativelyâ€”each level integrates and extends prior learning</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Mindset:</strong> All students can reach advanced levels with effort, practice, and effective feedback</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentic Assessment:</strong> Evaluate competencies through realistic, applied scenarios that mirror professional practice</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Students learn best when expectations are clear and criteria are explicit</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>For Faculty: Designing Learning Experiences</h3>
            
            <h4>Assignment Mapping</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Align to progression:</strong> Map assignments to expected competency levels based on program stage and course objectives</li>
                <li><strong>Scaffold deliberately:</strong> Design assignment sequences that build skills progressively within and across courses</li>
                <li><strong>Provide rubrics in advance:</strong> Share competency levels and criteria before assignments so students understand targets</li>
                <li><strong>Use consistent language:</strong> Reference rubric terminology in instructions, feedback, and grading to reinforce expectations</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Effective Feedback Strategies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be specific and actionable:</strong> Reference particular observable behaviors and suggest concrete next steps. "Your visualization effectively supported key points (Intermediate behavior #2). To strengthen further, practice anticipating audience questions in your narrative structure (Intermediate behavior #5)."</li>
                <li><strong>Describe developmental patterns:</strong> "You're consistently demonstrating Fundamental capabilities and showing emerging Intermediate skills in X and Y. Focus next on..."</li>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge growth trajectory:</strong> "Compared to your first assignment, you're now regularly demonstrating Intermediate behavior #3. Keep building on this momentum."</li>
                <li><strong>Balance affirmation with challenge:</strong> Recognize current capabilities while identifying the "emerging edge" where students should focus development efforts</li>
                <li><strong>Connect to future expectations:</strong> "This demonstrates solid Fundamental performance. In the next assignment, try incorporating Intermediate behaviors #2 and #4 to continue your progression."</li>
                <li><strong>Use growth-oriented language:</strong> "Not yet" instead of "can't," "developing" instead of "weak," "emerging" instead of "lacking"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Assessment: Measuring Competency Development</h3>
            
            <h4>Assessing Along a Continuum</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Describe patterns, not categories:</strong> Instead of "This is a Fundamental student," say "Student consistently demonstrates Fundamental capabilities with emerging Intermediate proficiency in X and Y"</li>
                <li><strong>Use threshold + trajectory language:</strong> "Has established Fundamental threshold and is progressing toward Intermediate in 3 of 4 competencies"</li>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge context-dependence:</strong> "Shows Intermediate performance on familiar tasks; Fundamental on novel, complex problemsâ€”consistent with expected development"</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on consistency over time:</strong> Look for patterns across multiple assignments, not single performances</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Assessment Best Practices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Select relevant criteria:</strong> Not every assignment assesses all behaviorsâ€”choose the most relevant 3-5 for each task</li>
                <li><strong>Use multiple measures:</strong> Assess competencies across several assignments to identify patterns and growth trajectories</li>
                <li><strong>Distinguish formative from summative:</strong> Use rubrics for ongoing developmental feedback and for final threshold evaluation appropriately</li>
                <li><strong>Track longitudinally:</strong> Monitor competency development across course sequences to ensure progression toward program goals</li>
                <li><strong>Allow for uneven development:</strong> Students may advance at different rates in different competenciesâ€”this is expected and reflects individual strengths and priorities</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Evidence-Based Evaluation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Portfolio approach:</strong> Collect evidence of competency across multiple artifacts, contexts, and time points</li>
                <li><strong>Look for multiple indicators:</strong> Identify 3-4 observable behaviors from target level demonstrated across different assignments</li>
                <li><strong>Inter-rater reliability:</strong> When multiple instructors assess competencies, calibrate interpretations through norming sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Student self-assessment:</strong> Include reflection components where students evaluate their own competency development and set growth goals</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Use assessment data to refine curriculum, pedagogy, and support structures</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Reporting Student Progress</h4>
            <div class="assessment-examples">
                <div class="example-good">
                    <strong>âœ“ Effective Progress Description:</strong>
                    <p>"Sarah consistently demonstrates Intermediate competency in Data Storytelling and Analytical Reasoning. She shows emerging Intermediate capabilities in AI-Augmented Analytics, particularly in prompt engineering and output validation. Her Collaborative Analytics skills remain at the Fundamental level but are developing, with recent evidence of more proactive knowledge sharing."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="example-avoid">
                    <strong>âœ— Avoid Classification Language:</strong>
                    <p>"Sarah is an Intermediate student." (Too vague, doesn't capture development pattern)</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Assignment Planning Framework</h3>
            <p>When designing assignments and mapping them to competencies, consider these guiding questions:</p>
            
            <h4>Alignment Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level targeting:</strong> Which competency level (Fundamental/Intermediate/Advanced) should students demonstrate at this program stage?</li>
                <li><strong>Observable behaviors:</strong> Which 3-5 specific behaviors from the rubric can this assignment authentically assess?</li>
                <li><strong>Scaffolding:</strong> How does this assignment build on prior work and prepare students for subsequent challenges?</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Are students demonstrating multiple competencies together, as they would in professional practice?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Support Mechanisms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What feedback will students receive?</strong> Plan formative checkpoints, peer review, or draft reviews to support development</li>
                <li><strong>What resources are available?</strong> Identify exemplars, templates, tutorials, or office hours that help students succeed</li>
                <li><strong>How will students reflect?</strong> Include metacognitive components where students assess their own competency growth</li>
                <li><strong>What happens when students struggle?</strong> Define intervention strategies and support pathways for students below expectations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practical Implementation: Making This Work</h3>
            
            <div class="implementation-practical">
                <h4>Using This Framework Realistically</h4>
                <p>This framework is comprehensive by design, but practical implementation requires selectivity and strategy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not every assignment assesses all 4 competencies</strong>â€”select 1-2 per assignment that align with learning objectives</li>
                    <li><strong>Not every behavior needs assessment</strong>â€”focus on 3-4 priority behaviors per assignment rather than all 6-7</li>
                    <li><strong>Use formative assessment liberally</strong>â€”provide developmental comments more often than formal rubric scoring</li>
                    <li><strong>Leverage technology</strong>â€”use rubric features in Canvas/Blackboard to reduce manual tracking and provide consistency</li>
                    <li><strong>Start small and scale</strong>â€”pilot with one competency in one course before expanding to full program implementation</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Reducing Faculty Burden</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create quick-reference guides:</strong> One-page summaries of just the behaviors list for each competency</li>
                    <li><strong>Build assignment-specific rubrics:</strong> Pull only relevant behaviors for each task rather than using the full framework</li>
                    <li><strong>Share the assessment load:</strong> Different faculty can focus on different competencies within courses</li>
                    <li><strong>Use peer assessment strategically:</strong> Students can provide formative feedback on selected behaviors, reserving faculty assessment for summative evaluation</li>
                    <li><strong>Batch similar assignments:</strong> Assess the same competency across multiple students simultaneously for calibration and efficiency</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Building Over Time</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Focus on establishing reliable Fundamental assessment and faculty norming</li>
                    <li><strong>Year 2:</strong> Add Intermediate tracking and begin building exemplar library from student work</li>
                    <li><strong>Year 3+:</strong> Implement full developmental tracking with portfolio assessment and program-level analytics</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Equity and Inclusive Practice</h3>
            
            <div class="equity-section">
                <p>This framework recognizes that students enter the MSBA program with varied educational backgrounds, work experiences, cultural contexts, and learning needs. To implement this framework equitably:</p>
                
                <h4>Recognizing Diverse Strengths</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Communication styles vary culturally:</strong> Effective data storytelling may look different across contexts. Focus on clarity, impact, and audience connection rather than conformity to a single presentation style. What counts as "professional communication" in one culture may differ in another.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prior experience shapes starting points:</strong> Students from industry bring different strengths than those coming straight from undergraduate programs. Students with technical backgrounds may start stronger in analytical reasoning but need more support in storytelling. Recognize and leverage these diverse entry points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple valid paths to competency:</strong> Some students excel in written analysis, others in verbal presentation, others in visual communication. Provide multiple ways to demonstrate competency where possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Practical Equity Strategies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Provide explicit instruction on norms:</strong> Don't assume students know "professional business communication" normsâ€”teach them explicitly with examples. This particularly supports first-generation students and international students.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use diverse examples and scenarios:</strong> Ensure case studies, datasets, and scenarios reflect varied industries, geographic contexts, and organizational types.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scaffold collaborative work:</strong> Teamwork competencies may be new to students from educational systems emphasizing individual work. Provide explicit frameworks and support for effective collaboration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be mindful of language barriers:</strong> For multilingual students, distinguish between language proficiency and analytical capability. Consider extended time or alternative formats when appropriate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Address technology access:</strong> Ensure AI tools and software used in competency development are accessible to all students, not just those with personal resources.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Accessibility and Accommodations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Work with disability services:</strong> Adapt assessment methods while maintaining competency standards for students with documented disabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider universal design:</strong> Build flexibility into assessments (e.g., written report OR recorded presentation) that benefits all students</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide alternative formats:</strong> When presentations are required, consider allowing pre-recorded videos for students with anxiety or speech differences</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="equity-commitment">
                    <strong>Ongoing Commitment:</strong> Equitable implementation requires regular reflection on whose voices, experiences, and ways of demonstrating competency are privileged by our assessments. Faculty should periodically review assessment data disaggregated by student demographics to identify unintended bias patterns and adjust accordingly.
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>For Students: Understanding Your Development</h3>
            
            <h4>Navigating the Competency Continuum</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expect uneven development:</strong> It's normal to be stronger in some competencies than others. Your profile will be unique and should align with your career interests</li>
                <li><strong>Understand that context matters:</strong> You might perform at Intermediate level on familiar tasks but revert to Fundamental approaches with new, complex challenges. This is expected!</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on trajectory, not just current state:</strong> Ask yourself "Am I demonstrating higher-level skills more consistently than last month?" rather than "What level am I?"</li>
                <li><strong>Recognize that setbacks are part of growth:</strong> Struggling with new material doesn't mean you've regressedâ€”it means you're pushing your boundaries</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Self-Assessment Strategies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Review your work against rubrics:</strong> For each assignment, identify which 3-4 behaviors you demonstrated and which you're still developing</li>
                <li><strong>Look for patterns over time:</strong> Are you showing Intermediate behaviors more frequently? In more contexts? With less support?</li>
                <li><strong>Identify your "emerging edge":</strong> What's the next level behavior you're starting to demonstrate? Focus deliberate practice there</li>
                <li><strong>Map your competency profile:</strong> Where are you strongest? Where do you want to grow? How does this align with your career goals?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Setting Effective Growth Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Instead of "Get better at storytelling," try "Consistently design visualizations that reveal patterns (Intermediate behavior #2)"</li>
                <li><strong>Target adjacent skills:</strong> If you're solid at Fundamental, focus on 2-3 Intermediate behaviors, not jumping to Advanced</li>
                <li><strong>Seek varied practice:</strong> Demonstrate emerging skills across different contexts to build consistency</li>
                <li><strong>Request targeted feedback:</strong> Ask instructors/peers to evaluate you on specific behaviors you're working to develop</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect regularly:</strong> Monthly self-assessment helps you notice growth that might feel invisible day-to-day</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Getting the Most from Feedback</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ask for developmental feedback:</strong> "What emerging capabilities do you see?" not just "What level am I?"</li>
                <li><strong>Identify your next steps:</strong> What specific behaviors should you practice to strengthen your trajectory?</li>
                <li><strong>Compare across assignments:</strong> How has your performance evolved over the semester?</li>
                <li><strong>Celebrate growth:</strong> Acknowledge when you demonstrate new capabilities, even if not yet consistent</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="student-example">
                <h4>Example: Student Self-Assessment</h4>
                <p><em>"At the start of the semester, I was consistently at Fundamental level for Data Storytellingâ€”I could organize findings but struggled to adapt to audiences. Now, I'm showing Intermediate capabilities more often: my last three presentations successfully translated technical findings for business stakeholders (Intermediate behavior #4), and I'm starting to anticipate questions in my narrative (Intermediate behavior #5). I still need work on designing sophisticated visualizations (Intermediate behavior #2). My goal this month is to practice visualization design on every assignment and seek feedback specifically on that skill."</em></p>
