            <h1>MSBA Competency Framework</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">A Progressive Development Model for Business Analytics Excellence</div>
        </div>

        <div class="intro-text">
            <p><strong>About This Framework:</strong> This competency framework defines the essential capabilities that MSBA students develop throughout their program. Each competency progresses through three developmental levelsâ€”Fundamental, Intermediate, and Advancedâ€”reflecting increasing sophistication, independence, and strategic application.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Philosophy:</strong> Built on evidence-based pedagogical principles, this framework emphasizes growth mindset, authentic assessment, and real-world application. Students are expected to demonstrate cumulative mastery, with each level building upon and integrating prior learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="understanding-framework">
            <h2>ðŸ“š Understanding This Framework</h2>
            
            <h3>A Developmental Continuum, Not Fixed Categories</h3>
            <p>These competency levels represent a <strong>developmental continuum</strong> rather than mutually exclusive categories. This design reflects how learning actually works:</p>
            
            <div class="framework-principle">
                <h4>âœ“ Students demonstrate capabilities across multiple levels simultaneously</h4>
                <p>It's normal to show consistent Fundamental skills while exhibiting emerging Intermediate capabilities in some areas. Competency development is uneven and context-dependentâ€”you might be Advanced in storytelling but still developing AI integration skills.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-principle">
                <h4>âœ“ Performance varies by context, task complexity, and domain familiarity</h4>
                <p>The same student might demonstrate Intermediate competency on familiar tasks but regress to Fundamental approaches when facing novel, complex, or high-pressure situations. This is expected and normal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-principle">
                <h4>âœ“ Assessment identifies patterns and trajectories, not classifications</h4>
                <p>Rather than labeling students as "a Fundamental student," assessment should describe patterns: "Consistently demonstrates Fundamental capabilities with emerging Intermediate skills in X and Y." Focus on growth trajectory, not fixed placement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-principle">
                <h4>âœ“ Growth is evidenced by increasing consistency at higher levels over time</h4>
                <p>Development means showing Intermediate capabilities more frequently, in more contexts, and with greater independence. Advanced level represents sustained mastery that you can demonstrate across diverse, complex situations.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Progressive Mastery:</strong> Competencies build cumulativelyâ€”each level integrates and extends prior learning</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Mindset:</strong> All students can reach advanced levels with effort, practice, and effective feedback</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentic Assessment:</strong> Evaluate competencies through realistic, applied scenarios that mirror professional practice</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Students learn best when expectations are clear and criteria are explicit</li>

            <h3>For Faculty: Designing Learning Experiences</h3>
            
            <h4>Assignment Mapping</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Align to progression:</strong> Map assignments to expected competency levels based on program stage and course objectives</li>
                <li><strong>Scaffold deliberately:</strong> Design assignment sequences that build skills progressively within and across courses</li>
                <li><strong>Provide rubrics in advance:</strong> Share competency levels and criteria before assignments so students understand targets</li>
                <li><strong>Use consistent language:</strong> Reference rubric terminology in instructions, feedback, and grading to reinforce expectations</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Effective Feedback Strategies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be specific and actionable:</strong> Reference particular observable behaviors and suggest concrete next steps. "Your visualization effectively supported key points (Intermediate behavior #2). To strengthen further, practice anticipating audience questions in your narrative structure (Intermediate behavior #5)."</li>
                <li><strong>Describe developmental patterns:</strong> "You're consistently demonstrating Fundamental capabilities and showing emerging Intermediate skills in X and Y. Focus next on..."</li>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge growth trajectory:</strong> "Compared to your first assignment, you're now regularly demonstrating Intermediate behavior #3. Keep building on this momentum."</li>
                <li><strong>Balance affirmation with challenge:</strong> Recognize current capabilities while identifying the "emerging edge" where students should focus development efforts</li>
                <li><strong>Connect to future expectations:</strong> "This demonstrates solid Fundamental performance. In the next assignment, try incorporating Intermediate behaviors #2 and #4 to continue your progression."</li>
                <li><strong>Use growth-oriented language:</strong> "Not yet" instead of "can't," "developing" instead of "weak," "emerging" instead of "lacking"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Assessment: Measuring Competency Development</h3>
            
            <h4>Assessing Along a Continuum</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Describe patterns, not categories:</strong> Instead of "This is a Fundamental student," say "Student consistently demonstrates Fundamental capabilities with emerging Intermediate proficiency in X and Y"</li>
                <li><strong>Use threshold + trajectory language:</strong> "Has established Fundamental threshold and is progressing toward Intermediate in 3 of 4 competencies"</li>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge context-dependence:</strong> "Shows Intermediate performance on familiar tasks; Fundamental on novel, complex problemsâ€”consistent with expected development"</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on consistency over time:</strong> Look for patterns across multiple assignments, not single performances</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Assessment Best Practices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Select relevant criteria:</strong> Not every assignment assesses all behaviorsâ€”choose the most relevant 3-5 for each task</li>
                <li><strong>Use multiple measures:</strong> Assess competencies across several assignments to identify patterns and growth trajectories</li>
                <li><strong>Distinguish formative from summative:</strong> Use rubrics for ongoing developmental feedback and for final threshold evaluation appropriately</li>
                <li><strong>Track longitudinally:</strong> Monitor competency development across course sequences to ensure progression toward program goals</li>
                <li><strong>Allow for uneven development:</strong> Students may advance at different rates in different competenciesâ€”this is expected and reflects individual strengths and priorities</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Evidence-Based Evaluation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Portfolio approach:</strong> Collect evidence of competency across multiple artifacts, contexts, and time points</li>
                <li><strong>Look for multiple indicators:</strong> Identify 3-4 observable behaviors from target level demonstrated across different assignments</li>
                <li><strong>Inter-rater reliability:</strong> When multiple instructors assess competencies, calibrate interpretations through norming sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Student self-assessment:</strong> Include reflection components where students evaluate their own competency development and set growth goals</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Use assessment data to refine curriculum, pedagogy, and support structures</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Assignment Planning Framework</h3>
            <p>When designing assignments and mapping them to competencies, consider these guiding questions:</p>
            
            <h4>Alignment Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level targeting:</strong> Which competency level (Fundamental/Intermediate/Advanced) should students demonstrate at this program stage?</li>
                <li><strong>Observable behaviors:</strong> Which 3-5 specific behaviors from the rubric can this assignment authentically assess?</li>
                <li><strong>Scaffolding:</strong> How does this assignment build on prior work and prepare students for subsequent challenges?</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Are students demonstrating multiple competencies together, as they would in professional practice?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Support Mechanisms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What feedback will students receive?</strong> Plan formative checkpoints, peer review, or draft reviews to support development</li>
                <li><strong>What resources are available?</strong> Identify exemplars, templates, tutorials, or office hours that help students succeed</li>
                <li><strong>How will students reflect?</strong> Include metacognitive components where students assess their own competency growth</li>
                <li><strong>What happens when students struggle?</strong> Define intervention strategies and support pathways for students below expectations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Students: Understanding Your Development</h3>
            
            <h4>Navigating the Competency Continuum</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expect uneven development:</strong> It's normal to be stronger in some competencies than others. Your profile will be unique and should align with your career interests</li>
                <li><strong>Understand that context matters:</strong> You might perform at Intermediate level on familiar tasks but revert to Fundamental approaches with new, complex challenges. This is expected!</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on trajectory, not just current state:</strong> Ask yourself "Am I demonstrating higher-level skills more consistently than last month?" rather than "What level am I?"</li>
                <li><strong>Recognize that setbacks are part of growth:</strong> Struggling with new material doesn't mean you've regressedâ€”it means you're pushing your boundaries</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Self-Assessment Strategies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Review your work against rubrics:</strong> For each assignment, identify which 3-4 behaviors you demonstrated and which you're still developing</li>
                <li><strong>Look for patterns over time:</strong> Are you showing Intermediate behaviors more frequently? In more contexts? With less support?</li>
                <li><strong>Identify your "emerging edge":</strong> What's the next level behavior you're starting to demonstrate? Focus deliberate practice there</li>
                <li><strong>Map your competency profile:</strong> Where are you strongest? Where do you want to grow? How does this align with your career goals?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Setting Effective Growth Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Instead of "Get better at storytelling," try "Consistently design visualizations that reveal patterns (Intermediate behavior #2)"</li>
                <li><strong>Target adjacent skills:</strong> If you're solid at Fundamental, focus on 2-3 Intermediate behaviors, not jumping to Advanced</li>
                <li><strong>Seek varied practice:</strong> Demonstrate emerging skills across different contexts to build consistency</li>
                <li><strong>Request targeted feedback:</strong> Ask instructors/peers to evaluate you on specific behaviors you're working to develop</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect regularly:</strong> Monthly self-assessment helps you notice growth that might feel invisible day-to-day</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Getting the Most from Feedback</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ask for developmental feedback:</strong> "What emerging capabilities do you see?" not just "What level am I?"</li>
                <li><strong>Identify your next steps:</strong> What specific behaviors should you practice to strengthen your trajectory?</li>
                <li><strong>Compare across assignments:</strong> How has your performance evolved over the semester?</li>
                <li><strong>Celebrate growth:</strong> Acknowledge when you demonstrate new capabilities, even if not yet consistent</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Example: Student Self-Assessment</h4>
                <p><em>"At the start of the semester, I was consistently at the Fundamental level for Data Storytellingâ€”I could organize findings but struggled to adapt to audiences. Now, I'm showing Intermediate capabilities more often: my last three presentations successfully translated technical findings for business stakeholders (Intermediate behavior #4), and I'm starting to anticipate questions in my narrative (Intermediate behavior #5). I still need work on designing sophisticated visualizations (Intermediate behavior #2). My goal this month is to practice visualization design on every assignment and seek feedback specifically on that skill."</em></p>
